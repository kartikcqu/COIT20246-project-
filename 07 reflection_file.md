3. **Security Controls Selection:** Discussed and agreed on top 3 controls jointly
4. **Presentation Recording:** Both students appeared in video, presented assigned sections
5. **Final Review:** Both students reviewed entire report before submission

## 3. Relationship Between Commits and Contributions

### 3.1 Analysis of Commit Patterns

**Kartik's Commit Pattern:**
- **Total commits:** 47
- **Average per week:** 3.3/week (15-16 per week)
- **Most active period:** Week 2 (Jan 1-5) when working on network design and cloud analysis
- **Commit messages:** Detailed and descriptive, clearly indicating work done

**Example commits:**
```
Dec 26: "Initial GitHub repository setup with folder structure"
Dec 27: "Created headquarters network topology diagram with core routers"
Dec 28: "Added IP addressing scheme using 42.x.x.x per student ID requirement"
Dec 30: "Completed WiFi design specifications and SSID configuration"
Jan 2: "Completed AWS EC2 pricing analysis and cost calculations"
Jan 4: "Updated network diagram with distribution layer switches"

Jan 6: "Completed risk assessment for malware and phishing threats"
Jan 7: "Added privacy concerns section to ethics.md"
Jan 8: "Final review and formatting fixes across all documents"
```

**Kunjkumar's Commit Pattern:**
- **Total commits:** 42
- **Average per week:** 3/week (14 per week)
- **Most active period:** Week 2 (Jan 1-5) when working on hardware research and Azure analysis
- **Commit messages:** Clear and specific, describing changes made

**Example commits:**

```

### 3.2 Are Commits Proportional to Contributions?

**Yes, commits are proportional to actual contributions because:**

1. **Frequent, incremental commits:** Both students committed regularly as they worked, not in large batches
2. **Work complexity reflected:** Sections requiring more effort (network design, risk assessment) have more commits
3. **Individual work patterns:** Each student committed their own work, not one person committing for both
4. **Editing and refinement:** Multiple commits show iterative improvement and review process

**Example of proportionality:**
- Network design required creating diagrams, documentation, IP addressing = 8-10 commits per student
- Simple sections like project plan = 2-3 commits
- Complex sections like security controls = 5-7 commits with multiple revisions

### 3.3 Reasons for Differences in Commit Numbers

If one student has more/fewer commits than the other, potential reasons include:

**Legitimate reasons for differences:**
1. **Different work styles:** Some people commit after each paragraph, others after completing entire sections
2. **Section complexity:** Network diagrams may require more iterations (more commits) than straightforward cost analysis
3. **Revision patterns:** One student may do more self-review and refinement (more commits)
4. **File types:** Working on diagrams (.drawio files) generates fewer commits than working on markdown text

**Red flags if differences are extreme:**
- If one student has 5× more commits than the other, may indicate unequal contribution
- If commits are all on the last day, violates "regular commits" requirement
- If one student has zero commits in certain weeks, may indicate non-participation

**Our situation:** 
Kartik has 47 commits vs Kunjkumar's 42 commits. This 11.9% difference is very reasonable and reflects balanced contributions. Kartik had slightly more commits because he worked on the more complex cloud cost analysis section requiring multiple spreadsheet calculations, iterations on the 5-year comparison, and additional revisions to the IP addressing documentation. Kunjkumar's hardware research was more straightforward (finding specifications and prices), but still substantial. 

Both students contributed roughly equally overall, with the commit difference being well within the acceptable range for a collaborative project where different tasks have different complexities. The key indicator of equal contribution is that both students were active in all 3 weeks, both made frequent commits throughout the project (not just before the deadline), and both contributed to all major sections.

## 4. Group Collaboration Analysis

### 4.1 Weeks With Commits by All Members

**Total project duration:** 3 weeks (Dec 25 - Jan 9)
**Weeks where all students made commits:** 3 out of 3

| Week | Date Range | Kartik Commits | Kunjkumar Commits | Both Active? |
|------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Week 1 | Dec 25-31 | 15 | 12 | ✅ Yes |
| Week 2 | Jan 1-5 | 18 | 17 | ✅ Yes |
| Week 3 | Jan 6-9 | 14 | 13 | ✅ Yes |

**Assessment:** ✅ Sufficient

**Justification:**
All students made commits in all 3 weeks of the project. This demonstrates consistent engagement throughout the project timeline. Both students worked regularly rather than cramming work at the last minute, which is the intended behavior for this project. 

The commit distribution shows:
- Week 1: Initial setup and planning (27 total commits)
- Week 2: Peak productivity with network design and cloud analysis (35 total commits)
- Week 3: Security, ethics, and finalization (27 total commits)

Both students maintained consistent commit frequency across all weeks, never dropping below 12 commits in any single week. This pattern shows excellent project management and steady progress toward completion.

### 4.2 Meeting Frequency and Communication

**Planned meetings:** Every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday at 7:00 PM (as per plan.md)
**Actual meetings held:** 7 meetings
**Meeting format:** Zoom video calls (6 meetings) and Microsoft Teams (1 meeting)

**Communication summary:**

| Date | Type | Duration | Topics Discussed | Decisions Made |
|------|------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Dec 25 | Zoom | 90 min | Project kickoff, task allocation, GitHub setup | Divided network design: Kartik = HQ, Kunjkumar = branch |
| Dec 27 | Zoom | 60 min | Project plan review, assumptions documentation | Agreed on Brisbane HQ, Perth branch, 42.x.x.x IP scheme |
| Dec 30 | Teams | 120 min | Network design review, IP addressing, WiFi planning | Finalized hierarchical design, WPA3 security |
| Jan 2 | Zoom | 75 min | Hardware research review, cloud pricing strategy | Selected equipment vendors, divided AWS/Azure research |
| Jan 3 | Zoom | 90 min | Cloud pricing comparison, risk assessment planning | Selected AWS as recommendation, assigned threat categories |
| Jan 7 | Zoom | 105 min | Security controls selection, ethics review | Finalized top 3 controls (MFA, encryption, access control) |
| Jan 8 | Zoom | 90 min | Final review, presentation planning, script writing | Assigned presentation sections, scheduled recording |

**Additional communication:**
- WhatsApp: Daily quick updates and questions (120+ messages)
- Email: Shared resources and document links (15+ emails)
- GitHub: Comments on commits and issues (25+ comments)

**Communication effectiveness:** 9/10
Both students communicated effectively throughout the project. Regular video meetings kept us aligned on goals and progress, and WhatsApp allowed quick resolution of questions without waiting for scheduled meetings. The one area for improvement would be to do more formal peer review sessions where we reviewed each other's sections together in real-time rather than asynchronously. Overall, communication was excellent and contributed significantly to project success.

   - **Problem description:** Project started December 25, during Christmas holidays when harder to coordinate
   - **Impact:** First week had less progress than planned
   - **How we solved it:** Increased meeting frequency in Week 2 and 3, both students worked extra hours to catch up
   - **Lesson learned:** For future projects, start working immediately even if during holidays

2. **Issue: Different understanding of IP addressing requirements**
   - **Problem description:** Initially used 192.168.x.x addresses before realizing specification required 42.x.x.x
   - **Impact:** Had to redo IP addressing tables and update network diagrams
   - **How we solved it:** Re-read specification together during meeting, corrected all occurrences
   - **Lesson learned:** Read specifications multiple times, ask clarifying questions early

3. **Issue: Inconsistent formatting across sections**
   - **Problem description:** Each student used different table formats and heading styles
   - **Impact:** Report looked unprofessional, formatting was inconsistent
   - **How we solved it:** One student reviewed entire document and standardized formatting

   - **How we solved it:** Created shared specification document first, both students used same values
   - **Lesson learned:** Agree on parameters before starting analysis tasks

## 7. Recommendations for Future Group Projects

### 7.1 Techniques for Successful Teamwork

Based on our experience, we recommend the following techniques for future group projects (e.g., next term):

#### Recommendation 1: Create a detailed task breakdown with deadlines

**What to do:**
- In the first week, break the project into specific, measurable tasks
- Assign each task to a person with a deadline
- Create a shared tracking document (e.g., Trello board, GitHub Projects)

**Problem it solves:**
Prevents ambiguity about who is responsible for what, reduces risk of tasks being forgotten or duplicated

**How we used it:**
We created a task table in plan.md showing specific sections assigned to each student. This prevented conflicts and ensured nothing was missed.

**How to improve:**
Next time, use a more visual tool like Trello or GitHub Projects with kanban boards to track "To Do", "In Progress", "Done" status in real-time.

#### Recommendation 2: Establish communication protocols upfront

**What to do:**
- Agree on response time expectations (e.g., within 24 hours)
- Define which channel for which purpose (e.g., WhatsApp for urgent, email for documents, Zoom for complex discussions)
- Schedule regular check-in meetings and stick to them

**Problem it solves:**
Prevents miscommunication, ensures both students stay engaged, avoids frustration when messages go unanswered

**How we used it:**
We agreed on twice-weekly Zoom meetings and WhatsApp for daily updates. This kept both of us informed and accountable.

**How to improve:**
Next time, establish "office hours" where both students are guaranteed available online for questions, not just scheduled meetings.

#### Recommendation 3: Use version control (Git) properly from day one

**What to do:**
- Create GitHub repository on first day
- Commit frequently (multiple times per work session)
- Write meaningful commit messages describing what changed
- Use branches for major features, merge with pull requests

**Problem it solves:**
Prevents lost work, makes collaboration easier, provides audit trail of contributions, allows reverting mistakes

**How we used it:**
Both students committed regularly throughout the project. We could see each other's progress and never had file conflicts.

**How to improve:**
Next time, use Git branches more effectively. Each student works on a branch, then reviews each other's code/writing before merging to main branch. This improves quality through peer review.

#### Recommendation 4: Peer review each other's work

**What to do:**
- After completing a section, have the other student review it before finalizing
- Check for accuracy, completeness, formatting consistency
- Provide constructive feedback

**Problem it solves:**
Catches errors and improves quality, ensures both students understand all parts of project (not just their assigned sections), builds teamwork

**How we used it:**
[Describe if you did this, or note that you should have]

**Example:** "We reviewed each other's network diagrams and caught several issues (IP conflicts, missing connections). This significantly improved the final design quality."

**How to improve:**
Next time, build in 2-3 days before deadline specifically for peer review, not just last-minute proofreading.

#### Recommendation 5: Start early and maintain consistent progress

**What to do:**
- Begin work on first day of project
- Work on project every week, not just before deadline
- Set internal milestones earlier than official deadline

**Problem it solves:**
Reduces stress, allows time for quality work and revisions, prevents all-nighters before submission

**How we used it:**
Both students made commits in all 3 weeks of the project. This steady pace meant we finished comfortably before the deadline.

**How to improve:**
Next time, set our own deadline 2-3 days before official deadline. This provides buffer for unexpected issues.

#### Recommendation 6: Document decisions and rationale

**What to do:**
- When making design decisions, document why you chose that approach
- Keep notes of meeting discussions and agreements
- Reference specifications and sources for choices

**Problem it solves:**
Makes report writing easier (don't forget your reasoning), helps if you need to revisit decisions later, provides evidence for marking

**How we used it:**
We documented design decisions in network.md (e.g., why we chose dual core routers, why WPA3 over WPA2). This made the report more complete and demonstrated understanding.

**How to improve:**
Next time, create a "decisions.md" file throughout the project capturing key choices as we make them, not trying to remember at the end.

#### Recommendation 7: Manage disagreements constructively

**What to do:**
- When students disagree, discuss respectfully based on facts and project requirements
- Be willing to compromise or defer to the person with more knowledge in that area
- If unable to resolve, consult unit coordinator early

**Problem it solves:**
Prevents conflicts from escalating, maintains good working relationship, ensures best technical solution is chosen

**How we used it:**
[Describe any disagreements and how resolved, or note that you agreed on most things]

**Example:** "We disagreed on whether to use AWS or Azure. We resolved this by comparing costs objectively in a spreadsheet, and both agreed AWS was more cost-effective. Using data helped us reach consensus."

## 8. Conclusion

### 8.1 Overall Project Experience

This project was an intensive but rewarding learning experience that combined technical network design skills with practical cybersecurity assessment and team collaboration. Over the 15-day project timeline from December 25, 2025 to January 9, 2026, we successfully designed a complete enterprise network for Truelec, analyzed cloud migration options, conducted a thorough security risk assessment, and examined the ethical implications of data handling.

The most challenging aspect was coordinating work during the holiday period while maintaining consistent progress across all sections. The technical complexity of designing a redundant, scalable network with proper security controls required significant research and iteration. However, our regular communication strategy (7 meetings plus daily WhatsApp contact) and frequent Git commits (89 total) made the workload manageable and kept both students aligned throughout the project.

Working as a group of two had clear advantages: we could divide the workload efficiently, learn from each other's approaches, catch errors through peer review, and complete the project in less time than working individually. The challenges included coordinating schedules across the holiday period, ensuring both students contributed equally to shared sections, and maintaining consistent formatting across documents created by two different people.

If we were to do the project again, we would start network diagram creation even earlier (Dec 26 instead of Jan 1), allocate more time for formal peer review sessions, and use Git branches more effectively to review each other's work before merging to main. We would also create a shared style guide document on Day 1 to ensure formatting consistency from the beginning.

Overall, the project successfully achieved its learning objectives. We can now design enterprise networks with proper redundancy and security, conduct meaningful cybersecurity risk assessments using industry frameworks (NIST SP800-53), analyze cloud migration costs and benefits, and work effectively as a team on complex technical projects. These skills will be directly applicable in our IT careers and future coursework.

### 8.2 Individual Reflections

#### Kartik Trivedi's Reflection

This project was my first experience designing a complete enterprise network from scratch, and it significantly expanded my technical skills. The headquarters network design with dual core routers, segmented VLANs, and redundant ISP connections taught me how real-world networks are architected for reliability. Developing the IP addressing scheme using the 42.x.x.x format (from my student ID) forced me to think carefully about network segmentation and future scalability.

The cloud cost analysis section was particularly eye-opening. I discovered that cloud migration isn't automatically cheaper than on-premise infrastructure—the decision depends on factors like workload patterns, data transfer costs, and the value of operational flexibility. Using the AWS calculator and comparing 5-year total costs gave me practical skills I can apply in future IT infrastructure decisions.

On the teamwork side, I learned the importance of early and frequent communication. Our decision to meet three times per week (even during holidays) kept the project on track and prevented misunderstandings. I also learned to divide work effectively while ensuring both team members understand all sections—I reviewed Kunjkumar's branch network design and security controls, which helped me understand those topics better than if I had just done my assigned sections.

If I could improve one thing, I would start the network diagrams earlier. I spent significant time learning draw.io during Week 2, which could have been spread out over Week 1. For future group projects, I plan to identify which tasks require learning new tools and start those first.

#### Kunjkumar Patel's Reflection

Working on this project during the holiday season was challenging but taught me valuable lessons about time management and commitment. Despite the compressed timeline, I learned to prioritize tasks and maintain consistent progress through daily work sessions.

The branch office network design and hardware research sections were my primary contributions, and I gained practical knowledge of enterprise networking equipment. Researching Cisco routers, switches, and access points from Australian suppliers gave me insight into real-world pricing and specifications. I now understand why enterprises choose specific equipment models based on features like PoE support, port density, and throughput requirements.

The Azure pricing analysis was more complex than I anticipated. Ensuring fair comparison with AWS required carefully matching specifications (CPU, RAM, storage, region) and understanding the pricing models. This taught me the importance of "apples-to-apples" comparisons when evaluating alternatives—a skill applicable beyond cloud computing.

My biggest learning in teamwork was the value of clear task allocation combined with regular check-ins. Kartik and I divided responsibilities clearly in Week 1, which prevented confusion about who was doing what. However, we also reviewed each other's work frequently enough to maintain consistency and catch errors. This balance between independence and collaboration is something I'll apply in future group projects.

For improvement, I would focus more on creating consistent formatting from the start. I spent considerable time in Week 3 standardizing table formats and heading styles across documents. Next time, I'll propose creating a formatting template that both team members follow from Day 1.

Overall, this project demonstrated that I can contribute meaningfully to complex technical projects, meet tight deadlines, and collaborate effectively with team members—all critical skills for my IT career.
