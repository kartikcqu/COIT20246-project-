## Risk Management Plan

### Identified Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Contingency Plan |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Holiday period coordination** | High | Medium | Schedule extra meetings; use WhatsApp daily | Work evenings/weekends if needed |
| **Technical issues (software/hardware)** | Medium | Medium | Test all tools early; have backups | Use alternative tools (e.g., Lucidchart if draw.io fails) |
| **Internet connectivity problems** | Low | High | Both have backup internet (mobile hotspot) | Offline work on local files, sync later |
| **One member unavailable** | Low | High | Daily check-ins; early notification required | Remaining member continues, notify coordinator |
| **GitHub conflicts** | Medium | Low | Communicate before working on same files | Use branches, resolve conflicts together |
| **Time shortage** | Medium | High | Start early; daily progress tracking | Prioritize critical sections, extend work hours |
| **Misunderstanding requirements** | Medium | High | Re-read specification multiple times | Ask unit coordinator for clarification |
| **Unequal contribution** | Low | High | Clear task allocation; track commits | Escalate to unit coordinator if issue arises |

### Backup and Recovery Strategies

1. **Data Backup:**
   - Primary: GitHub repository (automatically backed up)
   - Secondary: Google Drive folder (manual backup every 2 days)
   - Local: Each student maintains local copy

2. **Communication Backup:**
   - Primary: WhatsApp
   - Backup: Email and phone calls

3. **Meeting Backup:**
   - If Zoom fails: Switch to Microsoft Teams
   - If both fail: Phone call + screen sharing via other platform
